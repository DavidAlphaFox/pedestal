= Server-Sent Events
:default_api_ns: io.pedestal.http.sse

The Pedestal service library includes support for
{sse} (SSE).

The SSE protocol defines a mechanism for sending event notifications from a server to a client using a form of long polling.
However, unlike conventional long polling, SSE does not send each event as a separate response, with an expectation that the client will make a new request in between each one.
Rather, SSE sends all its events as part of a single response stream.

The stream is kept alive over time by sending events and/or periodic heart-beat data.
In the event that the stream is closed for some reason, the client can send a request to re-open it and events notifications can continue.
All modern browsers have built in support for SSE via the
link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource[EventSource API].

== Making an SSE Interceptor

To define an endpoint that will send SSE, make a route with an interceptor
that invokes api:start-stream[] from its :enter callback.

`start-stream` requires a "ready function." The ready function will be called later, when Pedestal has prepared the HTTP response and informed the client that an SSE stream is starting.

== Request Processing

`start-stream` sets up the following conditions:

- Send HTTP response headers to tell the client that an event stream is starting
- Initiate a timed heartbeat to keep the connection alive

After that, it will call the ready function with two arguments: a {core_async}
channel for the events and the current interceptor context.

== Ready Function

The ready function may put events into the channel to send them to the client.
Events are maps with keys :name, :data, and :id.
All values should be strings (but will be converted to strings via clj:str[] if not).

Only the :data is required.

Alternately, the event may be a single value, and not a map; this value is treated as if it were a map with just the :data key.

When the ready function has finished sending events, it should close the channel.
Pedestal will then clean up the connection.

If a client closes its connection, Pedestal will close the event channel.
The next time the ready function tries to put a message into the event channel, the put call (`>!`, `>!!`, or `put!`) will return false.
The ready function must detect this and clean up any resources it allocated.

== Example

Here is an example that shows how an SSE event stream can be used.
