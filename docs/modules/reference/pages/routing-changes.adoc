= Routing Changes in 0.8

A significant part of the 0.8 development cycle has been to improve and upgrade routers.
In most cases, the new logic is a drop-in replacement for the old.

If you are upgrading from 0.7 or earlier, and _you implement your own routers or routing specifications_,
you will need to be aware of these changes.

== path constraints

Previously, query constraints were specified as regular expressions, but path constraints were
specified as strings (that were then converted internally to regular expressions). Starting in 0.8,
you may specify path constraints as either strings or regular expressions.
