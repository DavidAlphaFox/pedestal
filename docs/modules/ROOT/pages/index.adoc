= What is Pedestal?

image::animated-front-page-sample.gif[float="right",width=300]

Pedestal is a set of libraries that we use to build web services and applications. Pedestal runs in the back-end and can handle
anything from tiny static web sites, to traditional page oriented applications, to dynamic single page applications built using
server-sent events and WebSockets.

Pedestal scales up with your needs.

We wrote Pedestal to bring Clojure's key attributes, *Focus*, *Empowerment*, and *Simplicity*, to the Clojure web development.

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <div class="main-feature-row">
    <div class="main-feature">
      <h3>Ready for Production</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">Pedestal works with a huge variety of containers and deployment options. Deploy applications or microservices on unikernels, Docker containers, or as stand-alone JAR files, or a servlet-container WAR files.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="main-feature">
      <h3>Secure by Default</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">Pedestal automatically uses secure headers, CSRF-protection, and other best practices. It works with CORS to allow secure front end applications.</div>
    </div>

  <div class="main-feature-row">
    <div class="main-feature">
      <h3>Streaming</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">Pedestal lets you create dynamic applications with server-sent events and WebSockets. It leverages Clojure's extraordinary asynchronous capabilities and Java's efficient NIO operations.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="main-feature">
      <h3>Late Binding</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">Routers and Interceptors let Pedestal services apply different behavior based on each incoming request, rather than statically wrapping everything up during initialization.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="main-feature-row">
    <div class="main-feature">
      <h3>Composable</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">Pedestal is built from pieces that connect via protocols, giving you the flexibility to swap out any part with something
customized to your application.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="main-feature">
      <h3>Testable</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">Pedestal's core interceptor model breaks request processing into small pieces that are simple, often purely functional, and easy to
test; then lets you stack those pieces up to form your full application.</div>
