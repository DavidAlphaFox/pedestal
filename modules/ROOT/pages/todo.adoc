# Documentation Work Queue

Moving from jBake to Antora has been an opportunity to go over each individual page of documentation, and each example.

[IMPORTANT]
Incorrect documentation is worse than no documentation.

Not everything can be done in a single pass, so this space is being used to track
work that still needs to be done.

## General

- Make the reference docs more concise; hand holding is for the guides
- Dial back the "if you don't know Clojure" parts of some guides
- Add an intro with all the key terms
- Put the Guides and Reference into a reasonable order
- Make better use of xref: linking between pages
- Lots of broken links (currently in Howard's IntelliJ bookmarks)

## Antora Technical Stuff

- Maybe add another macro for linking to Clojure documentation, much like the api: macro
- Create a custom UI theme

## xref:index.adoc[]

- Currently just a placeholder
- Philosophy of Pedestal
- Key terms and concepts quickly
- Overview of the documentation

## xref:reference:server-sent-events.adoc[]

- Discuss options
- Map vs. string events

## xref:reference:service-map.adoc[]

- Break into service map vs. server map (on a new page) for things like :start-fn, etc.

## xref:reference:response-map.adoc[]

- Are response headers converted to lower case?
- :body may be extensible (e.g., chan)

## Missing

- "Pedestal with Component: Handlers and Dependencies" (never written)
