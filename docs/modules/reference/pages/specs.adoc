= Specs

Limited parts of Pedestal are described using
link:https://clojure.org/guides/spec[Clojure specs].

This includes the structure of the
xref:service-map.adoc[], and the various kinds of
xref:routing-quick-reference.adoc[route specifications].

Use of spec is entirely optional; specs are confined to their own namespaces
which are not loaded by the library itself.  You can, in your own application's tests, load these namespaces and instrument functions as appropriate.

Spec namespaces:

* api:*[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor.specs]
* api:*[ns=io.pedestal.route.specs]
* api:*[ns=io.pedestal.http.impl.servlet-interceptor.specs]
* api:*[ns=io.pedestal.http.specs]
* api:*[ns=io.pedestal.websocket.specs]
