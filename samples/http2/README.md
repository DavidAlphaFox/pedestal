# HTTP2

## Description

This very simple app demonstrates using Jetty's HTTP2 capabilties.

## Usage

1. Set the appropriate ALPN-Boot version within `project.clj` based on your JDK Version
2. Start the application: `lein run`
3. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to see an HTTP 1.1 message.
4. Go to [localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443/) to see an HTTP2 message.

You can also use an HTTP2-enabled command line client:

1. Direct HTTP2 clear-text request: `nghttp -v http://localhost:8080/`
2. Upgrade an HTTP/1.1 request to a clear-text HTTP2 request: `nghttp -vu http://localhost:8080/`

### Enabling HTTP/2 Push

Jetty fully supports HTTP/2 Push.  The easiest way to hook up Push for
all requests is with a ServletFilter - [PushCacheFilter](http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/stable-9/apidocs/org/eclipse/jetty/servlets/PushCacheFilter.html)
or [PushSessionCacheFilter](http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/stable-9/apidocs/org/eclipse/jetty/servlets/PushSessionCacheFilter.html).

You can also Push individual resources by hand, grabbing the [PushBuilder](http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/9.3.11.v20160721/apidocs/org/eclipse/jetty/server/PushBuilder.html)
directly from the [Servlet Request](http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/9.3.11.v20160721/apidocs/org/eclipse/jetty/server/Request.html#getPushBuilder--).

You can find more information in the [Jetty docs for configuring HTTP/2 Push](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/http2-configuring-push.html).
