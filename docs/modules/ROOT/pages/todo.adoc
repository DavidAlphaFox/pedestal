# Documentation Work Queue

Moving from jBake to Antora has been an opportunity to go over each individual page of documentation, and each example.

[IMPORTANT]
Incorrect documentation is worse than no documentation.

Not everything can be done in a single pass, so this space is being used to track
work that still needs to be done.

## General

- Make the reference docs more concise; hand holding is for the guides
- Dial back the "if you don't know Clojure" parts of some guides
- Add an intro with all the key terms
- Put the Guides and Reference into a reasonable order
- Make better use of xref: linking between pages
- Lots of broken links (currently in Howard's IntelliJ bookmarks)
- "Cognitect" -> "Nubank NA"
