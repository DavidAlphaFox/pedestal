= Sawtooth Router

== Motivation

Provide a router that can detect and report route conflicts.

== Why use it?

Sawtooth is similar to xref:prefix-tree-router.adoc[Prefix Tree] in how it generally operates,
and is nearly as fast -- within 5 to 10%  of prefix-tree in benchmarks, and on the order of a micro- (not milli-)
second to route a request.

Further, when the routing table consists only of static paths (that is, no path parameters), Sawtooth
has performance nearly as fast as xref:map-tree-router.adoc[] (a fraction of a micro-second to route a request).

Sawtooth's distinguishing characteristic is that it will, at startup, write (to standard error)
a report describing any conflicting routes.
This gives you, as the developer, feedback about routing problems.

== How to use it?

Sawtooth is the default router; it will be used when no value is specified for the :io.pedestal.http/router key
of the xref:service-map.adoc[].

== Caveats

The behavior of Sawtooth is not defined when there _are_ route conflicts;
prefix-tree expressly favors paths with path parameters over paths that are entirely static.

== Additional Notes

Like the prefix-tree and map-tree routers, query and path
constraints are not used in routing decisions. They are only used to
invalidate a route match.
