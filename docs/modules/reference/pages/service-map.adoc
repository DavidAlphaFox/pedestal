= Service Map
:reftext: service map
:navtitle: Service Map

[WARNING]
====
The service map is used with the
api:*[ns=io.pedestal.http] namespace.  Much of that namespace is deprecated in
Pedestal 0.8, and replaced with the
api:*[ns=io.pedestal.connector] namespace, which is centered on the
xref:connector-map.adoc[].
====

The service map is a blueprint that Pedestal uses to create all the necessary
parts to begin processing requests: a service function, server function, chain provider, router, routes, and
default set of interceptors.

[NOTE]
.Server vs. Service
--
A _server_ is just the part of the overall system that listens for requests and sends responses; it's
the part most closely tied to your underlying servlet container (Jetty, Tomcat, and so forth).
The _service_ runs the show: it's the server plus everything else: chain provider, the interceptors
(including those responsible for routing), and so forth.
--

An application creates the service map and passes it to
api:create-server[ns=io.pedestal.http].
The result is a _server_ map that is ready to be started.

Keep in mind, however, that this is strictly a convenience function
that assembles the parts for you. There are use cases where you would
not call `create-server`, but instead assemble a service function,
chain provider, and so forth, directly.

Pedestal may add other keys to this map for its own use. Other applications
should treat any such keys and their values as implementation details
and their behaviour will remain unspecified.

== Service Map Keys

NOTE: In the details below, ::http is an alias to :io.pedestal.http.

[cols="s,d,d,d", options="header", grid="rows"]
|===
| Key | Always present? | Type | Description

| ::http/allowed-origins
| N
| Function, map, or sequence of strings
| Determines which origins are allowed for the api:allow-origin[ns=io.pedestal.http.cors] interceptor. See "CORS" below.

| ::http/chain-provider
| N
| Function
| Only assigned when replacing the xref:servlet-interceptor.adoc[]. Receives the xref:service-map.adoc[], returns an updated map with whatever additional pieces the server function expects. (See ::http/type, below.)

| ::http/container-options
| N
| Map
| Map of options to pass to the container. Each container, such as xref:jetty.adoc[], defines it own container-specific options.

| ::http/enable-csrf
| N
| Map
| A settings map to pass to the api:anti-forgery[ns=io.pedestal.http.csrf] interceptor. See CSRF below.

| ::http/enable-session
| N
| Map
| A settings map to pass to the api:session[ns=io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares] interceptor. Settings are session-store specific. If non-`nil`, this interceptor is added. Default is `nil`.

| ::http/file-path
| N
| String
| File path used as root by the api:file[ns=io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares] interceptor. If non-`nil`, this interceptor is added. Default is `nil`.

  File system resources can also be exposed as xref:resources.adoc[routes].

| ::http/host
| N
| String
| Hostname, e.g., "localhost". Passed to the container. Defaults to `localhost` footnote:[
`localhost` is a safe default and works with local testing, as your test code will be on the same
host as the server. However, *only* connections originating on the local host will be accepted.
For production deployments, however, you will usually set this to be `0.0.0.0`, which
accepts connections from anywhere.  This is especially true when running
Pedestal inside a Docker container, as all connections (even those from the host, or
from another container on the same host) will be network, not localhost, connections.].

| ::http/initial-context
| N
| Map
| The initial xref:context-map.adoc[] that is passed through the interceptor chain;
  This option makes it possible to place values into the context for
  all requests.

| ::http/interceptors
| N
| Vector
| Vector of items that satisfy the  api:IntoInterceptor[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor] protocol.

| ::http/join?
| N
| Boolean
| If `false`, do not block the thread that starts the web server. Passed to the container.

| ::http/method-param-name
| N
| Keyword
| Query string parameter used to set the current HTTP verb. Default is :_method.

| ::http/mime-types
| N
| Map of String -> String
| Mime-types map used by the api:content-type[ns=io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares] interceptor. Default is `{}`.

| ::http/not-found-interceptor
| N
| Interceptor
| Interceptor to use when returning a 404 Not Found response. Default is the api:not-found[] interceptor.


| ::http/port
| N
| Integer
| Port for the running server. If `nil`, then no HTTP port will be opened
footnote:[This is the behavior of releases 0.7 and earlier as well, contrary to prior documentation.], and
the container should be configured to open a port for HTTPs traffic.

| ::http/resource-path
| N
| String
| File path used as root by the api:resource[ns=io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares] interceptor. If non-`nil`, the interceptor is added. Default is `nil`.

  Classpath resources can also be exposed as xref:resources.adoc[routes].

| ::http/router
| N
| Keyword or route constructor
| The router implementation to use. Can be :linear-search, :map-tree :prefix-tree, or :sawtooth, or a custom router constructor function.
  Defaults to :sawtooth.

| ::http/routes
| Y
| Function, `ExpandableRoutes`, or sequence of maps
| A route specification that can be processed by api:expand-routes[ns=io.pedestal.http.route] into a routing table.

| ::http/secure-headers
| N
| Map of keyword -> string
| A settings map for various secure headers. See "Secure Headers" below

| ::http/service-fn
| N
| Function
| A function which can be used as an implementation of the `jakarta.servlet.Servlet.service` method. The function is defined by api:create-server[ns=io.pedestal.http].

| ::http/service-fn-options
| N
| Map
| Service function options passed to
  api:http-interceptor-service-fn[io.pedestal.http.impl.servlet-interceptor].

| ::http/servlet
| N
| `jakarta.servlet.Servlet`
| Present if the servlet is running.

| ::http/start-fn
| N
| Function
| Zero-arity function that starts the server. *Part of the server map.*

| ::http/stop-fn
| N
| Function
| Zero-arity function that stops the server. *Part of the server map.*

| ::http/type
| Y
| Keyword or Function
| Container for service or server function. As a keyword, names the container - currently, only
  :jetty is supported out of the box.
  As a function, acts as the server function.
  When omitted, Jetty is the default.

| ::http/websockets
| N
| Map
| *Deprecated in 0.8*: Prior approach to xref:websockets.adoc#upgrade[websocket routing].

|===

== default-interceptors

The api:default-interceptors[] function is the primary user of the majority of the service map keys;
it builds and attaches the ::http/interceptors key (a list of interceptors) from the various other
service map keys, but only if the ::http/interceptors is itself nil or missing.

`default-interceptors` is called automatically from api:create-server[].

You may find that you do not rely on `default-interceptors` logic, but build your own interceptor
chain directly; in that case, simply attach the interceptors as ::http/interceptors before calling
api:create-server[].  Many of the other service map keys will not be needed, beyond ::http/port and ::http/type.

== Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

If the ::http/allowed-origins key is non-`nil`, the
api:allow-origin[ns=io.pedestal.http.cors]
interceptor is added. The default is `nil`.

The allowed values are:

- a function of one argument that returns a truthy value when an origin is allowed;
- a map containing the following keys and values :allowed-origins sequence of strings or a function, :creds boolean indicating whether the client is allowed to send credentials, :max-age a long indicating the number of seconds a client should cache the response, and :methods, indicating the accepted HTTP methods, defaulting to "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, PATCH, OPTIONS";
- a sequence of strings matching the scheme, host and port (`scheme://host:port`) of allowed origins.

== Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

When a value for ::http/enable-csrf is present, the
api:anti-forgery[ns=io.pedestal.http.csrf]
interceptor is added to the queue. This implies that support for HTTP sessions are enabled (Pedestal will add the
necessary interceptor automatically).

The value must be a map with the following keys:

|===
| Key | Value type | Description

| :read-token
| Function
| This function takes a request and returns an anti-forgery token or `nil` if the token does not exist.

| :cookie-token
| any
| truthy value for CSRF double-submit cookies

| :error-response
| Function
| This function takes the response body and returns a 403 Not Authorized response

| :error-handler
| Function
| This function takes the context and returns the appropriate response.

|===

Only one of :error-response or :error-handler may be specified.

=== Secure Headers

When the ::http/secure-headers value is present and non-`nil`, the api:secure-headers[ns=io.pedestal.http.secure-headers] interceptor is added.

If the key is simply not present in the service map, then a set of default secure headers will be provided:

|===
| Key | HTTP Header | Content

| :hsts-settings
| Strict-Transport-Security
| "max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains"

| :frame-options-settings
| X-Frame-Options
| "DENY"

| :content-type-settings
| X-Content-Type-Options
| "nosniff"

| :xss-protection-settings
| X-XSS-Protection
| "1; mode=block"

| :download-options-settings
| X-Download-Options
| "noopen"

| :cross-domain-policies-settings
| X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies
| "none"

| :content-security-policy-settings
| Content-Security-Policy
| "object-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:;"

|===

If the value for ::http/secure-headers is present, it may contain
keys and string values for the security headers. Any other keys will be ignored.

== Server Map

The api:server[] function converts the service map to a server map, along the way,
initializing a xref:container.adoc[container] (such as
xref:jetty.adoc[Jetty]); this will add the :http/start-fn and :http/stop-fn keys to the
service map, yielding the server map.

The api:start[] and api:stop[] functions use the two functions provided by the container function to start
and stop the container instance.

== Spec Validation

The service map can grow quite complex, with options controlling everything from routing, to
security, to container-specific options.

The service map may be validated via {clojure_spec}; this involves loading the
appropriate xref:specs.adoc[spec namespaces] and using
Clojure's built-in link:https://clojure.org/guides/spec#_instrumentation_and_testing[instrumention and testing support].
