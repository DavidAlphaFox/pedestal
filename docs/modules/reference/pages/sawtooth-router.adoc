= Sawtooth Router

== Motivation

Provide a router that can detect and report route conflicts.

== Why use it?

Sawtooth is similar to xref:prefix-tree-router.adoc[Prefix Tree] in how it generally operates,
and is nearly as fast -- within 5 to 10%  of prefix-tree in benchmarks, and on the order a micro- (not milli-)
second to route a request.

Sawtooth's distinguishing characteristic is that it will, at startup, write (to standard error)
a report describing any conflicting routes.
This gives you, as the developer, feedback about routing problems.

== How to use it?

Add the key :io.pedestal.http/router to the xref:service-map.adoc[] with the
value :sawtooth.

== Caveats

The behavior of Sawtooth is not defined when there _are_ route conflicts.

== Additional Notes

Like the xref:map-tree-router.adoc[], query and path
constraints are not used in routing decisions. They are only used to
invalidate a route match.
