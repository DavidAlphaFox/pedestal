= Routing Changes in 0.8

A significant part of the 0.8 development cycle has been to improve and upgrade routers.
In most cases, the new logic is a drop-in replacement for the old.

If you are upgrading from 0.7 or earlier, and _you implement your own routers or routing specifications_,
you will need to be aware of these changes.
