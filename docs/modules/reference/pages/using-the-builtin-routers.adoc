= Using the Built-in Routers

As documented in the
xref:routing-quick-reference.adoc[],
the built-in routers are xref:linear-search-router.adoc[], xref:prefix-tree-router.adoc[], and
xref:map-tree-router.adoc[] (which is the default).


An alternate router can be specified as the
`:io.pedestal.http/router` key in the xref:service-map.adoc[],
using one of the following keyword values:

- `:map-tree`
- `:prefix-tree`
- `:linear-search`
