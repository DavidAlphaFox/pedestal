Pedestal is a set of libraries that we use to build web services and applications. Pedestal runs in the back-end and can handle
anything from tiny static web sites, to traditional page oriented applications, to dynamic single page applications utilizing server-sent events and WebSockets.

Pedestal scales up with your needs.

We wrote Pedestal to bring Clojure's key attributes, *Focus*, *Empowerment*, and *Simplicity*, to the domain of  Clojure web development.

This documentation is for Pedestal version *{libs_version}*.

Pedestal requires Clojure 1.10 or later, and works with Servlet API 5.0 and Java 11 and up.

== Features

=== Ready for Production

Pedestal runs where Java runs: Applications can be deployed as standalone Clojure applications, or as WAR files in a servlet container.
Pedestal integrates with {otel} to give you visibility into your running services.

=== Secure By Default

Pedestal automatically uses secure headers,
enables https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery[cross site request forgery] protection,
and other best practices.

It works with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[cross-origin resource sharing] to
allow secure front end applications.

=== Easy Ramp Up

A simple Pedestal app fits into a few lines of Clojure; Pedestal includes a
xref:guides:embedded-template.adoc[deps-new template] for getting you started.
When you need more power, it's ready for you.

=== Testable

Pedestal's core interceptor model breaks request processing into small pieces that are simple, often free of side effects, and therefore easy to
test; then lets you stack those pieces up to form your full application.


=== Streaming

Pedestal supports creating dynamic applications with server-sent events and WebSockets.
Pedestal leverages Clojure's extraordinary asynchronous capabilities and Java's efficient NIO operations.

=== Composable and Extensible

Pedestal is built from components that connect via protocols, giving you the flexibility to swap out any part with something
customized to your application.
