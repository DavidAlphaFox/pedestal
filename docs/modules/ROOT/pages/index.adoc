= What is Pedestal?

image::animated-front-page-sample.gif[float="right",width=300]

Pedestal is a set of libraries that we use to build web services and applications. Pedestal runs in the back-end and can handle
anything from tiny static web sites, to traditional page oriented applications, to dynamic single page applications utilizing server-sent events and WebSockets.

Pedestal scales up with your needs.

We wrote Pedestal to bring Clojure's key attributes, *Focus*, *Empowerment*, and *Simplicity*, to the domain of  Clojure web development.

This documentation is for Pedestal version *{libs_version}*.
