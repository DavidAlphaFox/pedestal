= Development Mode

Pedestal can operate in two different modes: production, and local development.

Local development mode changes the behavior of a handful of macros and functions to support
xref:guides:live-repl.adoc[live development at the REPL].

Development mode is enabled by setting value of JVM system property `io.pedestal.dev-mode` to `true` at startup.

From the command line, this can be accomplished by using the `-J` switch:

    clj -J-Dio.pedestal.dev-mode=true ...

Alternately, you can update your `deps.edn` file, associating a JVM option with an alias:

[source]
----
   ...
   :aliases
     {:dev-mode
       {:jvm-opts ["-Dio.pedestal.dev-mode=true"]}
   ...
----

You can then reference the alias when starting a REPL session:

    clj -A:dev-mode ...

The var api:dev-mode?[ns=io.pedestal.environment] stores the boolean result derived from reading the system property;
there is no mechanism for turning development mode on or off during execution.
