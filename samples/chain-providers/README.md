# Chain providers

This sample demonstrates using Pedestal with a custom backend server.
Interceptor Chain Providers allow Pedestal to be used on top of any HTTP Server that's supported on the JVM.

## Getting Started

1. Start the application: `lein run-dev` \*
2. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to see: `Hello World!`
3. Read your app's source code at src/nio/service.clj. Explore the docs of functions
   that define routes and responses.
4. Learn more! See the [Links section below](#links).

## Configuration

To configure logging see config/logback.xml. By default, the app logs to stdout and logs/.
To learn more about configuring Logback, read its [documentation](http://logback.qos.ch/documentation.html).
